Student Attendance Analysis:

This project analyzes student attendance patterns to identify seasonal trends in absences and compare flu season and non-flu season attendance. The goal is to visualize how different times of year affect student participation and highlight insights that could support school planning and student performance improvement.

Overview:
The dataset includes daily attendance records with information such as date, enrolled students, present, and absent counts. Using D3.js, two charts were created: one showing total absences by season and another comparing flu season versus non-flu season absences.
