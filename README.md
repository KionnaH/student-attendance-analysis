Student Attendance Analysis

This project analyzes student attendance patterns to identify seasonal trends in absences and compare flu season and non-flu season attendance. The goal is to visualize how different times of year affect student participation and highlight insights that could support school planning and student performance improvement.

Overview
The dataset includes daily attendance records with information such as date, enrolled students, present, and absent counts. Using D3.js, two charts were created: one showing total absences by season and another comparing flu season versus non-flu season absences.
